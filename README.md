# JavaScript Projects:

1. **Trivia Game**: A trivia game based on 15 random questions. Players can answer questions to earn points, and their score is displayed on the screen. The game ends when the player reaches a score of 150 points.

2. **Timer**: A customizable timer that allows users to set the hours, minutes, and seconds. Users can start, stop, resume, and reset the timer. The screen turns gold when the timer reaches zero.

3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**: Play against the computer in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The first to reach 10 points wins. The computer's choice is random, and the user selects their move by clicking the corresponding figure.

4. **Calculator**: A simple calculator that allows users to perform calculations and see the results on the screen.

5. **Guess My Number Game**: Users guess a number between 1-100. The game provides clues (too high or too low) for incorrect guesses. The score starts at 100 and decreases with each mistake. A green screen indicates a correct guess, and a high score is recorded.

6. **Using Data from a Server with CRUD and REST API and work with LocalStorage: This project fetches product data from a server using async functions and await. The data is parsed into objects using `json()`, and it's displayed on the DOM.
The user can search the wanted product by search field, by range of prices, or other filters suggested by buttons (all products, products in stock, categories of smarphones, laptops or other products).

in cart page the user could change the quantities or delete the products and the prices will updated dynamically in cart page and the quantities also on main page.
